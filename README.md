## About News Classification
Text classification classifies text documents on the basis of words, phrases, combination of words etc. into predefined class labels. It classifies news data into six predefined classes namely Business, Tech, Sport, Health, Politics and Entertainment"

## Description
I used a News Data set to analyse the Category of the News. I used ML model as a Back End and used HTML and BOOTSTRAP as front end and used Flask as a rest API to launch my project as an API.
